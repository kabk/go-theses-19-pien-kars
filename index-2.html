						I am interested in which ways mythology affects our lives today. Since there is a broad perspective of aspects involving mythology and the way people deal with this, I choose to focus on one specific facet. This is how mythology/folklore/legends/fairy tales have influenced the lives of women, and if we can find aspects in these stories that may have helped women to find their voice in a society which for many years has seen them as lesser than men. In many cultures it is the wise old women that pass on the stories belonging to their culture. The stories, full of symbolism are there to inform you, to sooth you and to make you think about your place in the world. Because of this women were able to make their mark on history. So few stories are told from a woman’s perspective and/or place women as the protagonist. One of the fields where this did happen, is mythology. Folkloric myths and fairy tales have historically provided means of escape for women trapped in social roles, whether in the 	Greek tales of Artemis and Selene or the tales of the <strong><span class="item">Brothers Grimm</span></strong></p> .  
					Often these mythological stories are pushed away as fictive and less important than exact sciences, while actually a great deal of our society is based upon these myths. Which are the stories that could have helped us see the strength of women and pushed our ancestors to fight for our equal rights? Can we still find strength in these stories? What specific symbolism is linked to women and their powers? How does our society now cope with these stories, how can we relate them to our everyday lives? What is the importance of looking back in these often fictive stories?

						<b>1. WHAT IS MYTHOLOGY</b> 
					</p>


					<p>Till the 19th century everything that was contrary to reality was a myth. The literal translation from the word mythos in ancient Greek is story, fabel. A common, unimpeachable, but unfounded view. The whole of myths of a people is called mythology. It seems difficult though to say that the myths of our ancestors were merely stories told at a campfire, or performed in a play. These stories always contained some sort of life lesson, had hidden messages in every little nook and must have been taken serious at times. It was a way to explain the world around them and to understand what was happening in this world. Every nation and society had and still has their own founding folkloric myths upon which society relies for communicating and encountering with each other. 
					It is this mythology that gave people insights about the origin of the world, the skies, natural phenomena like snow, thunder and earthquakes. It was the base of the first religions. A guide to live your life. Before these stories were written down, they were passed on to each other by speech, mother to daughter, father to son. 

					Different theories on how mythology came to exist are taken on by theorists and writers. There was for example Ephemeris, who lived in the 3th century BC, who, in his book ‘Sacred History’, talks about how Gods are merely deified kings. That these kings could tell all about places and peoples because they used to make long travels. People then confused these stories into stories about gods over time. 
					Friedrich Max Müller, a German writer and philologist in the 19th century, thought myths originated because of language. What could first just be a single name for something or someone, could decompose into a deity due to linguistic combinations. Due to grammatical complications abstract ideas could get personifications, and become gods en goddesses. According to Müller that’s how a poetic display on a metrological phenomenon for example, could become a myth about Kronos: A god that eats it’s own children and spits them out. 

					“The past,” he wrote, “is continually needed to explain the present, and the whole to explain the part. E.B. Taylor. 

					W. Robert Smith talks about how a myth always explains a ritual. Therefore a myth will probably only exist long after the original ritual has lost it’s meaning. The myth is there to create a meaning of a ritual that is still there, although the actual meaning could be long gone. This would be a historical approach to explaining. 
					There are lots of scholars that believe that myth is an explanation on a ritual. What they have in common is that they see the man-made act is the fundamental element of religion and human culture, not the stories on divine acts. 

					Browislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) points out that the legitimacy of myths in social life. They charter social organization and precepts since “…they are socially relevant and living entities”. He thinks therefore myths are myths are different from folk tales, which always compose a form of entertainment. 
						
					Carl Jung and Freud are both scholars that take on a psychological theory through social sciences. Jung, a Schwiss psychiatrist and psychologist who died in 1961, regards myths as racial daydreams, which include archetypes, some sort of general elements, which are components of the mental structure of the human brain. Freud speaks of one primal act on the human condition: The murder of the primal father. This would have made the path free for religious and mythological thoughts. To Freud myths are also comparable to dreams. A way to fulfill wishes through fantasy. He thinks that (day)dreaming is an expression of suppressed human desires. 

					Levi Straus, explains mythology as structural interpretations, where structure is an unconscious logic system. This is a linguistic approach to explain the origin of myths. Levi-Straus points out that mythology has a purpose to provide a logic model which will resolve something of a contradiction which can arise. This logic is supposed to be as strict as the logic in natural sciences. The difference isn’t the thinking proces (the logic) but the way that the outcome is applied to the situation. A fundamental characteristic of mythical thinking is it’s concreteness, since it works with symbols. Symbols have the special quality of being in-between image and notion. Symbols resemble image as long as they are concreet, but can resemble notion when they reference something. He says we are using metaphors as instruments to facilitate expression of meaning in thought and language.
